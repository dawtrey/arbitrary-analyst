# The Dawtrey Manifesto


## Social


### Legal system

#### Sufficient funding for the CPS (expansion needed) 

The CPS's funding is at an all time low- the problem with our criminal justice system at the moment is not police numbers, it is funding at the rear end. 
*look at The Secret Barrister's twitter for relevant details*

#### Decriminalisation of marijuana use

The criminalisation of petty crimes like the recreational consumption traps criminals in the justice system in the long term. This issue also disproportionally affects certain communities, contributing to inequality within our society. In short, the utility of this law is not positive and so it is the government's responsibility to change it. 

#### Stricter prison sentences for tax cheats

It may be the case that this is already in place. It is definitely what you may call a 'populist' policy.


#### Reformation of copyright law for the information age

1. Decreasing the time window in which IP is protected.
1. Protect small online creatives whose use of IP falls under Fair Use clauses
### Education

#### Maintaining the current Free School policy 

This will help create competition in education.

#### Produce modern apprenticeship solutions. 

Provide some realistic markets for apprenticeships. The current system is not sufficient and the BTEC system only delays employment- there must be some alternative to this.  We must ensure, however, that the apprenticeships offered are in jobs that have a long term future- otherwise we will be training people with skills that will soon become redundant. 


#### Adult retraining readily available

Moving into an age where jobs are starting to be threatened by new technologies at a faster 
pace, there must be some support for retraining- probably private solutions in a nationally governed framework. 

#### Lessons in news literacy

It is now, more than ever, necessary to have an ability to discern good journalism from that which is bad or manipulative. Manipulation by orgatnisations such as Breitbart in the US combined with flooding the Facebook pages of swing voters in specific areas had a tangible impact of the election. 

### Healthcare

#### Providing schemes for older population to look after small children

This will help solve the double problem of shortage of staff and ever growing decades of unusefulness for the older generation. This will link to the retraining outlined above.

## Economic

### Fiscal

#### Land Value Tax

There is rarely a policy which is so supported by economists but is not inside political discourse. 

This would help solve the housing crisis faced in the UK. 

#### Negative Income Tax

This policy will help remove the high effective taxes that are faced by some workers. Providing good incentives to keep low earners in work and encourage those not seeking work to rejoin the market is an important part of the welfare state.  

### Environment, Food and Rural Affairs

#### Reformation of the definition of 'organic'

**Putting GM crops back into the definition of organic.**
 The current system makes the use of ecosystem destroying necessary in order to qualify for the 'organic' label. The use of genetically modified plants in production will contribute to far more sustainable farming practices. 
**A wide-spread re-evaluation of the harm and benefits of the pesticides.**
These laws were made decades ago and the research has gradually grown out of date; radical reforms are necessary. 

#### More nuclear and wind energy

Nuclear is a safe and efficient way of producing energy. Nuclear plants will be built if they remain cost effective. These will provide a stable base of power generation for when renewable energy sources are not able to produce electricity. 

#### Accelerated decommissioning of coal plants

If it is financially viable, coal plants will begin to be closed in order to reduce the UK's carbon footprint. 

#### Ambitious zero carbon goals

The specifics of this policy will depend on what is realistic and achievable. 

#### Punishment of combustion vehicles in urban areas

Air pollution is a health threat the urban population. This will go some way to stopping this or at least helping fund the amount that this costs the NHS. 

### Science

#### Untouchable science research funding

Science funding is a long-term investment and so is often cut by governments who need to divert spending.  

####  Funds specifically for energy generation research

The UK must lead the world in this field. Our companies being able to produce the energy production of the future will be an enormous comparative advantage. The cost and other barriers is the largest road block for climate unconscious governments all around the world, by lowering the barriers and making its costs competitive, even governments less willing to move on climate change will start investing in more favourable means of energy production. 

### Other


## Governance

#### Conversion to a Bundestag style of election

This is a more representative form of government, eliminating the need for tactical government. This is a hybrid between proportional and local representation. This government type promotes a more consensus-building type of government.

#### Long term renationalisation of the water supply

The system in the UK of a privatised water industry haemmorages money because of the lack of ability of real competition within the industry. It means that the long term costs for the taxpayer will be lower. This must be done in a costly manner in order that the gains from the policy are not wiped out as a result.  


PS: stop brexit
